[Archiving Confidant Notice](https://github.com/lyft/confidant/issues/439)
----------------------------------

As of 10/25/2024, we have made the decision to archive the Confidant project by 01/31/2025. This choice comes after careful consideration of the projectâ€™s direction, usage, and internal needs. Confidant will no longer receive updates or support, including issue triaging, pull request reviews, or feature development.
